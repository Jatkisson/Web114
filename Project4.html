                        practicing CSS is important as we will use JavaScript to modify styles soon too!</li>

                        alert(), confirm(), and prompt() are methods of the default object 
                        / Window object that allows developers to interact with the user
                    </dd>
                    <dt>2.  Why can we use the alert(), confirm(), and prompt() 
                        methods without preceding them with the object. (object dot) syntax??</dt>
                    <dd>
                        The alert(), confirm(), and prompt() are able to be used without 
                        the preceding object dot notation because it is the default global 
                        object does not require calling the object, but the alert(), 
                        confirm(), and prompt() methods will still work the same if the 
                        window object dot notation is used.
