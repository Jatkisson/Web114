                        practicing CSS is important as we will use JavaScript to modify styles soon too!</li>

                <dl>
                    <dt>1.  Identify the three major types of nodes found in an HTML document that we work with in JavaScript.</dt>
                    <dd>
                        
                    </dd>
                    <dt>2.  Why is the JavaScript textContent property safer than innerHTML?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        
                    </dd>
                    <dt>3.  Explain the relationship between an HTML element and a corresponding DOM object.  Explain the relationship between an HTML attribute and a corresponding DOM property (explain the connection to JavaScript).  Use a specific example in your answer.</dt>
                    <dd>
                        
                    </dd>
                    <dt>4.  Why do we rarely, if ever use document.write() ? (Hint:  I have a stand-alone YouTube on this subject for details,
                        Why the JavaScript document.write() statement is so confusing (Links to an external site.)
                        Why the JavaScript document.write() statement is so confusing)</dt>
                    <dd>
                        
                    </dd>
                    <dt>5.  What is a JavaScript method?  Define and provide two examples.</dt>
                    <dd>
                        
                    </dd>
                    <dt>6.  What is a JavaScript property? Define and provide two examples.</dt>
                    <dd>
                        
                    </dd>
                    <dt>7.   We have been working with three "built-in" objects that are already provided for us when we use JavaScript for its initial purpose -- to modify HTML and CSS in response to user interaction on the web page.  
                        Provide a sample method for each of these three objects:  window, document, and console.</dt>
                    <dd>
                        
                    </dd>
                    <dt>8.  What is a CSS selector? Define and provide two examples.</dt>
                    <dd>
                        
                    </dd>
                    <dt>9.  What is a CSS property? Define and provide two examples.</dt>
                    <dd>
                        
                    </dd>
                    <dt>10.  What is a CSS declaration? Define and provide two examples.</dt>
                    <dd>
                        
                    </dd>
                </dl>
            </div>
            <div id="Exercises">
            <h2>Exercises</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>1.  Write a script with these statements (place your script above the </body> closing tag).

                        console.log(document.body) //shows the element DOM tree.
                        
                        console.dir(document.body)// shows the element as a DOM object, good to explore its properties.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        2.  In the HTML, create an <h1> element with the text content of placeholder.  Use JavaScript to set its textContent property to "Johnson County Community College". 
                    </li>
                        3.  In the HTML, create three <h2> elements with the text content of placeholder.  Use JavaScript to set their textContent property to 3 different majors available at JCCC.   (Hint.  If you use HTML id attributes for each element, you can refer to that element directly in the JavaScript as the HTML id value can be automatically accessed as  JavaScript variable with the same name.  See the examples in the textContent section of the Node properties: type, tag, and contents lesson).
                    <li>    
                        4.  Write JavaScript to create and then append three more <h2> elements that contain 3 more JCCC majors.   Now you'll use JavaScript to create, modify, and also append the entire <h2> element versus what you did in steps 2 and 3 where the <h2>placeholder</h2> element was already in the HTML.
                    <li>

                    </li>
                        5.  Copy the JavaScript from the "Create a list" exercise at the end of the Modifying the document lesson into your script.  We haven't covered all of those JavaScript constructs yet, especially the while loop, but study and run the code to conceptually understand what is going on.  Add a comment behind every statement to explain every line of the code.
                    </li>
                    <li>    
                        6.  Write two JavaScript statements to modify the CSS associated with the <h1> element in your HTML.   In one, use the style property.  In the other, use the classList property.
                    </li>     
                </ol>
