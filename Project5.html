                        1.  What is the difference between a function 
                        declaration and a function expression?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        A function declaration is when a function is declared 
                        in a more familiar way to most other programming language, 
                        but a function expression is when a function can be 
                        declared like it is a variable.  When it is declared 
                        like a variable, then it can be used in the same way as 
                        a variable is declared or it can be declared as if it is 
                        a part of an object.  Function declarations are also 
                        different because they are available to be used whenever 
                        they are needed in a script, but function expressions 
                        must have the function already expressed or else it 
                        will not be able to be called in the script.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>2.  Why do we create functions in the first place?  
                        There are two big reasons.  One has to do with WHEN the 
                        statements in a function run.  The other has to do with how 
                        often the statements in a function are run.
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        Functions are needed because tasks can be needed at 
                        different times within a website.  If a function is used, 
                        then it can execute the task when the page is loaded 
                        or it can be used to respond to an action on the page.  
                        When a function is used, then tasks can be triggered 
                        at times beyond when the page is loaded.  The other 
                        benefit is that we can reuse the code in the function 
                        if it is written in a function and not listed on its 
                        own in the script tags.  When functions are written, then 
                        they can be reused to simplify the code as well as 
                        improving the maintenance of the code. When task are 
                        written within functions, then you only need to modify 
                        the function once and the calls to the function will 
                        all be updated right away.

            <h2>Exercises</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Use window methods to gather two pieces of information from a user, 
                        their age and also whether they want to proceed (true or false).  
                        Then, write a traditional if statement that checks whether the age 
                        value is greater than or equal to 18 as well as the proceed 
                        variable is TRUE.  If both conditions are true, change the 
                        textContent property of a &lt;p&gt; that is already in the HTML to 
                        their name plus the text " is legal" such as:  Lisa is legal.<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Copy the "Check the login" code from the Logical Operators 
                        exercise, but change the words/case to create a two-step 
                        test to identify your favorite sport and team (for example, 
                        if baseball, then Royals)...use whatever sport and team you like. 
                        <br><br>Add console.log statements that sensibly respond to all 5 
                        possible outcomes based on user interaction.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create a variable named secret assigned to a number between 1 
                        and 10.  Write a while loop that keeps prompting a user to enter 
                        a number between 1 and 10.  Stop prompting the user once the 
                        secret number is guessed.
                    </li>
                    <li>Write #3 again, but this time, use a do while loop.</li>
                    <li>
                        Write a for loop to console.log numbers between 1 
                        and 31 that are evenly divided by 3.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create a variable named house that is assigned to 
                        the value of a prompts for the user's Hogwart's House 
                        (Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff).  
                        Create a switch statement to console.log out an appropriate 
                        message based on the user's input.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Write #6 again, using if statements and different 
                        console.log messages.  Use house2 as the variable name.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Wrap #6 in  a function named sortingHat() 
                        using a function declaration.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create a variable named sortingHat2 and assign 
                        it to a function expression that wraps the code in #7.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Execute both the sortingHat and sortingHat2
                         functions as the last two statements in the script.
