                        practicing CSS is important as we will use JavaScript to modify styles soon too!</li>

                    <li>Add a script that alerts "Hi World!"</li>
                    <button id="Exercise1" onclick="exercise1()">Click to fire alert</button>

                    <script>

                    </script>
                    <li>In the script created in step 1, add a statement to console.log("Hi Insert Your Name");</li>
                    <button id="Exercise2" onclick="exercise2()">Click to fire alert</button>

                    <script>

                        }
                    </script>
                    <li>In the script created in step 1 and also step 4, include the "use strict": directive as the first line.</li>
                    <li>Add a second script that declares 2 variables:  a constant named myName assigned to your actual name 
                        as a string, and a variable named mySalary assigned to any number that you would like as a salary.  
                        Use console.log and the variable names to log out a phrase similar to the following:  My name is Lisa 
                        and my salary is 100000.  Note that you must include text in quotation marks (or apostrophes), but 
                        not variable names similar to the following: console.log("My name is " + myName + " and my salary is " + mySalary);</li>
                    <li>In the script you created in step 4, but below the first console.log, reassign the mySalary variable to a 150000.  
                        Add another console.log similar to the following:  My name is Lisa and my new salary is 150000</li>
                    <li>In the script you created in step 4, create a Boolean variable named veteran and assign it to 
                        true or false depending on whether you are a veteran or not.</li>
                    <li>In the script you created in step 4, add three console.log() statements to determine the data type of the myName, 
                        mySalary, and veteran variables.  An example is:   console.log(typeof(myName));</li>
                    <li>In the script you created in step 4, console.log each of these expressions (they are found at the end of the Type 
                        Conversions lesson) Make sure you understand these!  The + operator is the tricky 
                        one given it will NOT convert a string.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"" + 1 + 0</li>

                            <li>In two different statements after these variable declarations, console.log the value of c and d. </li>
                            <li>Add a comment to explain the value of c.</li>
                            <li>Add a comment to explain the value of d.</li>

                        console.log the value of x and y.
