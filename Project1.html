            <h2>Questions</h2>
                <dl>
                    <dt>What is the purpose of JavaScript?  Answer in general and also provide three 
                        specific examples of how JavaScript is commonly used.</dt>
                    <dd>
                        The purpose of JavaScript is to make a web page more interactive.  
                        HTML gives the structure, CSS gives the style, and JavaScript gives the 
                        page movement and life.  For example, Javascript can add new HTML to a page,
                        it can provide reactions to use actions within the page, and it can get and 
                        set cookies to provide a unique experience for the end user. 
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Who invented JavaScript and when?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>What software program will you be using to write JavaScript?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        I will be using Visual Studio Code as the program to write JavaScript 
                        for this course as I am somewhat familiar with the program and am comfortable
                        with using the software.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>What software program will you be using to run JavaScript?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        I will be using the Google Chrome browser to run Javascript.  This web browser 
                        uses the V8 Javascript engine to execute the language.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Why are external scripts preferable to scripts added directly within an HTML file?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        External scripts are preferred when developing web pages as the script can be 
                        reused on multiple pages and can be updated in one location instead of updating 
                        the script on each individual HTML page.

            <h2>Exercises</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Add a script that alerts "Hi World!"</li>
                    <li>In the script created in step 1, add a statement to console.log("Hi Insert Your Name");</li>
                    <li>In the script created in step 1 and also step 4, include the 
                        "use strict": directive as the first line.</li>
                    <li>Add a second script that declares 2 variables:  a constant named myName assigned to your actual name 
                        as a string, and a variable named mySalary assigned to any number that you would like as a salary.  
                        Use console.log and the variable names to log out a phrase similar to the following:  My name is Lisa 
                        and my salary is 100000.  Note that you must include text in quotation marks (or apostrophes), but 
                        not variable names similar to the following: console.log("My name is " + myName + " and my salary is " + mySalary);</li>
                    <li>In the script you created in step 4, but below the first console.log, reassign the mySalary variable to a 150000.  
                        Add another console.log similar to the following:  My name is Lisa and my new salary is 150000</li>
                    <li>In the script you created in step 4, create a Boolean variable named veteran and assign it to 
                        true or false depending on whether you are a veteran or not.</li>
                    <li>In the script you created in step 4, add three console.log() statements to determine the data type of the myName, 
                        mySalary, and veteran variables.  An example is:   console.log(typeof(myName));</li>
                    <li>In the script you created in step 4, console.log each of these expressions (they are found at the end of the Type 
                        Conversions lesson) Make sure you understand these!  The + operator is the tricky 
                        one given it will NOT convert a string.</li>
                    <li>In the script you created in step 4, add the following statements.</li>
                    <li>
                        In the script you created in step 4, add the following statements.  
                        In two different statements after these variable declarations, 
                        console.log the value of x and y.
                    </li>
                </ol>
