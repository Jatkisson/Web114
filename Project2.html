                    <dt>1.) At the end of the Browser environment lesson, the author makes 
                        this comment. "Now weâ€™ll get down to learning DOM, because the 
                        document plays the central role in the UI." <br> 
                        Explain this sentence to a non-technical person.  What is the DOM? 
                        What is the document? What is the UI?  
                        How does this relate to JavaScript?
                        </dt>
                    <dd>
                        The DOM is the document object model and this is crucial for several
                        reasons. The biggest reason is because computers are not very smart. 
                        JavaScript is used to make changes to the page and make things 
                        interactive, but without defining what "things" really are, the 
                        computer wouldn't be able to know.  The DOM is how we can define what 
                        all of the different pieces are and provide clarification for the 
                        computer.  For example, we can describe the section where instructions 
                        go and we can describe the section where questions go on the web page. 
                        These descriptions are stored in the DOM and allow the computer to know 
                        what these sections are and be ready to make any changes to these sections 
                        if person were to ask for the instructions or questions section to be changed.

                    <dt>2.) What specification documents does the author recommend 
                        (include the link and the description of the specification in your answer.)</dt>
                    <dd>
                        The author included several links for specifications in the "Browser 
                        environment, specs" section and the links go to different sections of 
                        w3.org and spec pages.  The links for these pages are below.<br>

                    <dt>3.) Explain the relationship between an HTML element that you write in a 
                        code editor, the DOM as it is presented by the browser, and a node in the DOM.</dt>
                    <dd>
                        An HTML element that is written in a code editor is part of what makes up 
                        the DOM once it is loaded in the browser. The DOM is the object that is built 
                        into the browser that organizes HTML elements and allows for the elements to 
                        be rendered and also manipulated by JavaScript. The DOM contains each HTML 
                        element and as more elements are added, then these create additional nodes 
                        or child nodes in the object. Therefore, the elements, DOM, and nodes in the 
                        DOM all work together to make up the document object once a web page is rendered 
                        in a browswer.

                        We haven't covered all of the JavaScript yet, but you 
                        should be able to conceptually understand what each 
                        statement is doing based on the explanations.  Add 
                        comments as shown below to explain what that statement

                        your script to demonstrate the navigation properties found in the Summary section of 
                        the Walking the DOM lesson.
